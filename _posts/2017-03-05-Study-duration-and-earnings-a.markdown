title: "Study duration and earnings; a test in relation to the human capital screening debate"
abstract: "In this paper we propose a simple test in relation to the human capital versus screening debate. It is argued that these theories lead to different predictions with respect to the earnings effects of deviations between actual and nominal durations of a study. Earnings and study duration equations are estimated to test these predictions. The results support the human capital theory."
