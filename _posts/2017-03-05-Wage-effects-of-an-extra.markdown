title: "Wage effects of an extra year of basic vocational education"
abstract: "Until 1975 lower vocational education in the Netherlands had a program length of either 3 or 4 years. In 1975 all 3-year programs were extended to 4 years. This was accompanied by an increase of the compulsory school leaving age with one year. We evaluate the long-term wage effects of the extra year of lower vocational education using a difference-in-differences approach. We find no beneficial effect from the change."
